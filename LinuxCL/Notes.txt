three of the "big ideas" embodied in Unix are:

Programs do one thing and do it well.
Programs work together.
Programs use text streams as the universal interface.

command [options] [arguments]
man mkdir >> for help
ls -al /etc --> all file in directort etc 
Use wildcards: (*, )
Suppose your current directory contains hundreds of image files, but you only want to see the PNG files—
(ls *.png) or (ls *.jp*g) --> jpg and jpeg 
The * wildcard matches on zero or more characters, but the ? wildcard represents a single character
by an uppercase or lowercase J or P, you could enter this:
ls *.[jpJP]*
ls [a-zA-Z]* --> over the directory
cat shows the content 
Some Bash commands can only be run by the root user—a system administrator or superuser. If you try one of these commands without sufficient privileges, it fails. For example, only users logged in as a superuser can use cat to display the contents of /etc/at.deny:
at.deny is a special file that determines who can use other Bash commands to submit jobs for later execution.

sudo stands for "superuser do." When you use it, you're telling the shell that for this one command, you're acting with the root-user level of permission.

The cp command copies not just files, but entire directories (and subdirectories) if you want. To make a copy of 0001.jpg named 0002.jpg,
cp 0001.jpg 0002.jpg

ps aux and ps -ef are the same. 
Or suppose you want to filter the output to include only the lines that contain the word "daemon." One way to do that is by piping the output from ps to Linux's useful grep tool:
ps -ef | grep daemon

The nl filter has flags that allow you to change the increment value (-i), change the numbering format (ln, rn, rz), or change the starting number (-v).


Stream_Editor
he basic usage of sed is sed [options] commands [file-to-edit].

For example, to use sed directly on the NASA-software-API.txt file, you would run the command as follows:
sed '' NASA-software-API.txt

Imagine that you have the URL https://www.nasa.gov/about/sites/index.html, and you want to replace index.html with home. You can make this replacement by using the following command: echo "https://www.nasa.gov/about/sites/index.html" | sed s'/index.html/home/'

We can use the flag -n to suppress automatic printing and pass the option p to the replacement flag, like so: sed -n 's/NASA/National Aerospace Agency/p' NASA-software-API.txt

Summary
Some of the key takeaways from this module are:

The cat command allows you to display, concatenate, and append files.
Pipes (|) send the output of one command as input of another command.
A filter takes input from one command, does some processing, and gives an output.
Regular expressions (regex) are used for pattern matching and can be used by other commands and tools, such as sed and grep.
The grep command can be used to find strings and values in a text file.
Piping through grep is one of the most common uses.
The most common use of the stream editor (sed) is text substitution.
